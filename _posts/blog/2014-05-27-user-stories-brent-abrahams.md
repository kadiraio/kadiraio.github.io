[Brent Abrahams](http://cn.linkedin.com/pub/brent-abrahams/87/372/ba1) is a mathematics teacher who has build an online curriculum management app [Standbench](http://cn.linkedin.com/pub/brent-abrahams/87/372/ba1) for his organization using Meteor. He has a [nice story](http://meteorhacks.com/meteor-in-production-a-case-study.html) with the initial stage of his applications and how he used Oplog with his application.

Recently, we was able to figure out a potential issue of one of his server with the data from Kadira. This is how he talked about it.

"Kadira did give me a heads-up a couple of days ago that one of my servers was in trouble, as I saw an unusual increase in the number of publications and methods being called.  So I restarted the server and watched everything settle back into the normal pattern.  That was nice!  The real-time aspect of the Kadira admin console is just great."

Brent also showed how he used Kadira with his development workflow.
