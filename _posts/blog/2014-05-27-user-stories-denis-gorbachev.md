[Denis](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev) is a well know figure in the Meteor community and he is the founder of [Pintask](https://pintask.me/). 

Pintask is the most customizable Kanban board. It provides rich features right out of the box, and allows to modify every function or add new one. This is done via extensions: available from Extensions Store or written by you in Javascript.

He has been using Kadira from the initial beta release and helped us a lot on identifying issues with Kadira. 

He showed us how he used Kadira with PinTask and used Kadira metrics to bring down Pintaks Response Time from 4 seconds to 1 second.
