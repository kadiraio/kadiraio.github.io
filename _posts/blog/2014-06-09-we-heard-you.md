Thank you all for your honest feedback. It has been a great (but busy) week for us and plenty of new apps are being monitored with Kadira.  Throughout the last week, Kadira placed in the Atmosphere's trending category, and we are really happy about it.

Thank You!

## Price Reduction

A lot of developers like you asked about the price reduction. The reason is simple: they are using platforms like Modulus, Digital Ocean and Nodejitsu to deploy Meteor apps. Most of them are starting up (including us). So $19 is bit high, especially if you have 5+ nodes of small virtual machines.

So we've cut the price of our StartUp plan in half. It now costs $9.99 per month/host. But we haven’t cut any features; you’ll get the original feature set we’ve listed for the StartUp plan.

So jump into the [StartUp Plan!](https://kadira.io/pricing.html) Analyze 2 weeks’ worth of data and get more insight with your team.

Simply visit <https://ui.kadira.io/account/plans> to change your plan.

> If you already have a StartUp plan, you don't need to do anything. You'll be billed with new pricing. We've already adjust your bill.
