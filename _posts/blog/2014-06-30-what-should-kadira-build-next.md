We are working on the next few major feature releases for Kadira. We would like to know your preference. Pre-order the feature you would most like to see in the next major release (scheduled for August 1).

## Real Client Monitoring

With Real Client Monitoring, you can learn how your app behaves in actual clients and find client-side bottlenecks. You'll be able to see:

* Load time of your app
* Time taken to connect to the DDP Server
* Time taken to load the initial subscriptions
* Time taken to render initial subscriptions
* Latency values for your methods and publications. You can also break them down into:
  * Network latency for sending requests
  * Server queue time
  * Server processing time
  * Network latency for receiving result/data

Comparisons with all of these metrics can be made against countries and browsers (mobiles, desktop, etc.).

> This is an add-on for your app and we charge [**$25 for 50K DDP connections per month**](https://gumroad.com/products/LyDy/edit). You can also enable this add-on even if you have a free plan.
>
> 1 DDP connection = 1 Reatime client who established a DDP connection

## CPU/Memory Profiling

You'll be able to create CPU and memory profiles for your app in both development and production. This is an add-on for your app.

The add-on shows:

* CPU-intensive packages in your app
* CPU-intensive functions and who created them
* Capture and compare heap dumps and learn how to find memory leaks with them

> You can enable this add-on for a [**$20/month**](https://gumroad.com/l/EqEf) flat free for you app. You can also enable this add-on even if you have a free plan.

## Better Error Manager

Currently, we track errors for methods only. With Error Manager, you'll be able to track all the server-side and client-side errors.

The improved Error Manager will be available for any app with a [**paid plan**](https://gumroad.com/l/fRGA).

> Client-side errors will be routed through your app. In future, you'll be able to send them directly to Kadira without routing them through your app.
