Even if you have built the perfect Meteor app, things might go wrong in production. You may encounter unexpected performance issues and errors.

Kadira is a great tool for finding such issues in your app, but you need to be logged in to Kadira to check. That's not ideal.

So, today we are introducing **<u>Kadira Alerts</u>**. It sends you a notification when something strange happens with your app. You can get alerts for almost every metric available in Kadira.

We do support email and webhooks as actions. You can also integrate Kadira Alerts with [zapier](https://zapier.com) and get notification into your phone and trigger many other services, including your Google Glass :)

It's super easy to create an alert. See:
