Method and pubsub tracing is the one of the most widely used features of our product. Some of you guys have shared traces on [meteor-talk](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/meteor-talk/frQxOm8ztbs/Uz1QlscBjY4J) and posted [issues](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/pull/338#issuecomment-49514529) on GitHub simply by taking a screenshot.

So, we wanted to make it simple to share traces. From today, you can share any of your traces publicly directly from Kadira. Other people will be able to inspect your traces and suggest fixes or give feedback.

This feature is available for everyone regardless of their plan. Additionally, all the publicly shared traces will be available forever and we won't delete them.

I hope you guys will love this and get the most out of it.

P.S. Simply ask a question on [crater.io](http://crater.io) by sharing a trace. I will personally go through each one of them and respond back to you.
