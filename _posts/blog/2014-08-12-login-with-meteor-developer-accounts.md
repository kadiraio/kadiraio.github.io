Few months ago, MDG [introduced](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/02/25/meteor-developer-accounts) Meteor developer accounts and allowed developers to authenticate deployments to `*.meteor.com`.

As a part of that, [accounts-meteor-developer](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/02/25/meteor-developer-accounts#usingtheaccountsmeteordeveloperpackage) package was introduced. It allows third party applications to authenticate users via Meteor developer accounts.

From today onwards, Kadira's default authentication mechanism is Meteor developer accounts. We still have the password based login system, but we highly encourage you to use Meteor developer accounts.

In order to enable login with Meteor, you need to first [login](https://ui.kadira.io/sign-in) with your existing password based account.

Then visit your [profile](https://ui.kadira.io/account/profile) and connect your Meteor developer account. If you don't have a Meteor developer account yet, don't worry! You'll be asked to create a new account.

If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to [contact us](http://support.kadira.io/).
