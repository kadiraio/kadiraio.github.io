Currently, we are re-structuring our paid plans and trying to offer more affordable plans with more features. (Yep! There will be an awesome announcement planed for later this week).

As a part of that process, we've [increased](https://kadira.io/pricing.html) the price of our [StartUp](https://kadira.io/pricing.html) plan to $19 from $9.99 and increased the **collaborators** limit to **10** (previously 5). 

> Anyway, we've no intention to change our **FREE** plan.

If you've any suggestions/questions about this change, please don't hesitate to [contact us](http://support.kadira.io/).

## Meteor 0.9 Update

Just after the Meteor 0.9 release, we've updated our [kadira](https://github.com/meteorhacks/kadira) smart package to Meteor 0.9 and you can add it to your Meteor app with:

    meteor add meteorhacks:kadira

If you are still using 0.8.3 or an earlier version, don't worry; `kadira` smart package is backward compatible and supports even if you are using Meteor 0.6.5.
