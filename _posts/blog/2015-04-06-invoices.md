title: Get a Monthly Invoice for Your Kadira Account
permalink: /blog/get-a-monthly-invoice

Most of our paid users requested an invoice every month from us. So, we prepared them manually and it was not perfect and not punctual. We are extremely sorry about the inconvenience.

From today onwards, you'll get an automated invoice every month via an email. To update your billing address, visit the [billing page](https://ui.kadira.io/account/billing) in Kadira UI. 

You can also download previous invoices from that page.

> It'll take upto 5 minutes to update your billing address with our invoice processing service.  So, keep that in mind when you are downloading invoices.
