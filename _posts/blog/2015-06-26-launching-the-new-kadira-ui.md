Today, we are super excited about the launch of the new version of Kadira UI. We've been developing this for almost 6 months. Now it's ready and you can start using it from today.

> If your app has multiple users, you need to add them again from the new app. This is a temporary measure and we'll be able to migrate users automatically in a few weeks from now.

### What's New?

We decided to develop the new version of Kadira UI with two goals in mind:

1. Speed 
2. Maintainability

We spent a lot of time experimenting with speed improvements while keeping it easy to add new features. This was not just to make our app faster, but we were trying to push the limits in Meteor. [Flow Router](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router) and [Flow Components](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-components) are two of the results of this.

Take a look at the new UI and you'll experience the speed improvements.

I'll write an article on [MeteorHacks](https://meteorhacks.com/) about the decisions we took and the challenges we faced.

### What's Next?

This new version does not comes with any extra features other than a few minor changes to the look and feel. But it does lay out the foundation for the new features we've just started to develop.

In the coming months, you'll get more UI related improvements and some new features from Kadira. Here are a few of the things we have on our roadmap:

* Full screen chart support (to view charts with a lot of hosts)
* Improved error manager (filter errors and add notes)
* Track deploys and server restarts
* Additional ranges (3 hours and 1 month)
* More system metrics
