Methods and publications are the heart of Meteor. Kadira tracks several performance metrics for each method and publication, including response time and throughput.

##Traces

Method and pub/sub "traces" help you to see whatâ€™s really happening with a given method or publication at a glance.

To view a trace, just click on a point in the Response Time Breakdown chart. Traces can also be shared very easily with a public URL.
