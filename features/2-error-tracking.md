Errors are inevitable for any app even if you’ve written the prefect app, so you need to get ready to handle errors. That’s where Kadira’s error tracking solution comes into play.

With Kadira, you can track both client and server errors automatically. You can also track your own errors if you prefer. Using Kadira’s Error Manager, you can analyze error traces and quickly debug issues even before your customers notice them.
