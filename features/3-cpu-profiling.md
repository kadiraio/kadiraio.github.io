CPU profiling helps you to find CPU-intensive functions and packages in your app. Based on those profiles, you can take action to optimize your app. CPU profiles are very effective, but unfortunately, they are hard to take and analyze. 

We solve this problem with a very simple way to [take a profile](academy/meteor-cpu-profiling/) from your Meteor app. After you’ve taken the profile, you can analyze it without leaving Kadira. Our analyzer is very simple and easy to understand even if you’ve no experience in CPU profiling.

The Kadira [CPU analyzer](/academy/analyze-meteor-cpu-profile/) shows you where your app spends CPU resources, and then you can try to optimize based on that. If you need to dive into details,  you can use built-in flamegraphs to analyze your CPU profile.
